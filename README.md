# KLUTCH
A web-application designed to increase interconnectivity at NCAT through social, academic, and professional means.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION: In the vibrant environment of North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NCAT), ef-
fective communication and collaboration among students are integral to fostering a thriving academic
community. However, despite the presence of numerous social media platforms and on-campus forums,
there is a noticeable lack of dedicated spaces where students can interact academically, socially, and
professionally in a focused and meaningful way. At NCAT, the absence of a comprehensive intercon-
nectivity platform limits studentsâ€™ ability to seamlessly exchange textbooks, form study groups, offer
tutoring services, promote student-run businesses, and access exclusive student-centric deals. Existing
platforms, designed for broader audiences, fail to address the specialized needs of NCAT students. Con-
sequently, there is a pronounced need for a tailored solution that can bridge these gaps and create a
unified hub for student interactions. To address this issue, we propose a purpose-built web application
designed to serve as a centralized hub for academic, social, and professional interactions among NCAT
students. This platform aims to integrate various facets of student life into a unified space, fostering
increased engagement, collaboration, connectivity, and entrepreneurship within the NCAT community.
With these three major components, students will be able to connect and speak freely with like-minded
individuals, exchange textbooks and notes, form study groups, offer tutoring services to their peers,
and access exclusive student-centric deals on campus. Lastly, they will be able to promote student-run
businesses and build a genuine connection with their audience.

PRODUCT SCOPE: From our perspective, we see KLUTCH as more than just a senior project but a potential gift to our
campus community, a creation that comes from our shared realization of the genuine need for stronger
student connections. Imagine a dynamic platform where academic, social, and entrepreneurial aspects
seamlessly blend and form a vibrant campus hub. To us, KLUTCH is a legacy and a testament to our com-
mitment to enhancing the campus experience. As transfer students, we recognize the potential impact
of such a platform, particularly for freshmen and newcomers seeking to navigate campus life more ef-
fectively. KLUTCH stands out as a valuable semester-long project with a unique value proposition: it not
only enhances campus life and community engagement but also fosters innovation and entrepreneur-
ship among students. The user-centric design that will be implemented and personalized experiences

demonstrate our commitment to addressing the specific needs of diverse student populations. Ulti-
mately, KLUTCH aims to leave a lasting mark, providing a valuable resource for future generations of
students and contributing significantly to the continuous enhancement of the campus community.
